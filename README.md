# PeaceAndTranquility
An Android app that does nothing but play "Peace and Tranquility" from A Hat in Time on loop.

## Why?
I thought that this would be a pretty funny idea.

## What does it do?
It plays the "Peace and Tranquility" video from A Hat in Time on loop â€” nothing more, nothing less.

## How?
It's just a VideoView that plays the video, combined with code that makes it full screen.

## What does it run on?
It'll run on anything that can run Android 6 or later.

## Are there controls for the video?
Nope! That's the beauty of it.
